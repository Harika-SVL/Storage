#### AWS Storage Popular Customers

Example-1 : Drop Box (now they have their own infra)

![alt text](shots/1.PNG)

Example-2 :  Amazon Prime music/videos, Netflix

![alt text](shots/2.PNG)

### Backup and Archival

* _**Backup**_ is meant for recovering quickly from failures, as they are commonly occuring
* _**Archival**_ is meant for recovering from disasters, even when it takes time

![alt text](shots/3.PNG)

* _**Cloud Storage**_ solutions are very popular and cheaper for both backup and archival solutions

### Data Engineering

* Every organization has data, which is used for two purposes :
    * Business Intelligence
    * Machine Learning / AI
* Data in your orgnaization comes from :
    * Databases
    * DataWare houses
    * PDF / WORD / TEXT
    * Images
    * Big Data:
        * Hadoop
        * Spark
* Importing data into cloud in the form of lakes etc.. (_**Cloud Storage infrastructure**_)
* Here we need to understand the cloud storage infra services

#### Object Storage for Streaming / media Solutions

* S3 + Cloudfront (Netflix and Amazon Prime)

#### Block Storage for Virtual Machines

* EBS (_**Elastic Block Storage**_)

#### Units in Storage

* KB vs KiB
* IOPS
* Throughput

#### File Shares (Network Storage)

* EFS (Elastic File Share)
* Fsx

### Storage Services by AWS

![alt text](shots/4.PNG)

#### Object Storage

* This is a kind of storage where we can store any file and object, for the users who doesnot have any file system. Access to files in the object storage is done over `http(s)`
* _**S3 (Simple Storage Service)**_ is the object storage - `Storage As A Service`

### AWS Simple Storage Service _**(s3)**_

* S3 has buckets. Each Bucket can have folders or objects
* Individual object cannot be greater than 5 TB of storage
* Let's create an S3 bucket

=> Navigate through s3       

![alt text](shots/5.PNG)

=> Create bucket

![alt text](shots/6.PNG)

=> select Bucket type : General purpose => Give bucket name : qtstoragedemo

![alt text](shots/7.PNG)

 => select Object Ownership : ACLs disabled => Block all public access : unselect

![alt text](shots/8.PNG)

=> select the acknowledge => Bucket Versioning : Disable

![alt text](shots/9.PNG)

=> Encription type : Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) => Bucket key : Enable => Create bucket

![alt text](shots/10.PNG)

=> select the bucket created to insert any content 

![alt text](shots/11.PNG)

=> Upload : select the files need to be uploaded => Upload

![alt text](shots/12.PNG)

=> copy URL

![alt text](shots/13.PNG)

* The URL is `https://qtstoragedemo.s3.amazonaws.com/one.mp4` 

* Price involved in S3 : AWS charges for using `s3` in two dimensions
    * Storage size
    * Access costs
* To adjust Access and Storage costs, aws has `Access Tiers`
    1.  _**Standard**_: accesed frequently
        * Access cost - less
        * Storage cost - high
    2. _**Infrequent access**_:
        * Storage cost - less
        * Access cost - high
    3. _**Glacier**_
        * Storage cost - very low
        * No access costs
* Now let's understand pricing at high level 

  [ Refer Here : https://calculator.aws/#/ ]

    *Example : Size: 10 TB
        * _**Standard**_:
            * Storage cost ~= 235 $
            * Access 1000 TB ~= 716 $
        * _**Infrequent**_:
            * Storage cost ~= 128 $
            * Access 1000 TB ~= 10,240.00
        * _**Glacier**_:
            * Storage cost ~= 12 $
#### Terms

  * _**Durability**_ : This property defines what is the chance of data not getting corrupted
  * _**Availability**_ : This property defines how much time in an year (calculated in %) is the data available
* Amazon defines `Durability` and `Availability` on the basis of _**redundancy**_ (copies of the data available)

### Redundancy
    
* By default AWS creates 3 copies of each object and stores them in 3 different zones
* If we select `reduced redundancy`, then it stores only in one zone
* Create s3 bucket with `ACLs enabled` and ensure `block all public access` is unselcted

=> Create bucket

![alt text](shots/14.PNG)

=> Bucket type : General purpose => Bucket name : qtstoragedemoforaccess 

![alt text](shots/15.PNG)

=> Object Ownership : ACLs enabled => Bucket owner preferred 

![alt text](shots/16.PNG)

=> Block all public access : unseleccted => select acknowledge 

![alt text](shots/17.PNG)

=> Encryption type : Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) => Bucket Key : Enable => Create bucket

![alt text](shots/18.PNG)

* Upload any object into some folder (music)

=> select qtstoragedemoforaccess => Create folder => Folder name : music => Create folder

![alt text](shots/19.PNG)
![alt text](shots/20.PNG)

=> Create folder => Folder name : videos => Create folder

![alt text](shots/21.PNG)

=> select music folder => upload : one.mp3 and two.mp3 => Permissions : Grant public- read access = Upload

![alt text](shots/22.PNG)
![alt text](shots/23.PNG)

=> Properties => select Standard => Upload

![alt text](shots/24.PNG)
![alt text](shots/25.PNG)

=> select the file and copy URL => Check over the browser with the URL

![alt text](shots/26.PNG)

* The URL is `https://qtstoragedemoforaccess.s3.amazonaws.com/music/one.mp3` i.e _**https://(<s3-bucketname).s3.region.amazonaws.com/(<object)**_

=> Try similar for videos upload too

![alt text](shots/27.PNG)

* The URL is `https://qtstoragedemoforaccess.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/two.mp4` i.e _**https://(<s3-bucketname).s3.region.amazonaws.com/(<object)**_

### Storage Classes

1. _**Standard (default)**_ :
  * Frequently accessed
  * high storage cost
  * more redundancy
  * free tier plan (5 GB)
  * most widely used
2. _**Infrequent Access**_ :
  * For older data which is not frequently used
  * Storage cost - less
  * access cost - more
  * Redundancy - more
3. _**One Zone - IA**_ :
  * less durable and infrequent access
4. _**Intelligent Tier**_ : where aws chooses storage class based on usage.

* To change storage class 

=> select the bucket => select object => object actions => Edit storage class => select the storage class => Save changes

[_**Note**_ : It is difficult to do individually for many number of objects from a bucket]

* I want to have the object :
    * for the first 30 days in Standard
    * 31-180 days in Onezone â€“ ia
    * 181-1000 days in Glacier
    * 1001 day delete
* For the above mentioned cases, aws has _**Storage lifecycle**_

### Storage Lifecycle

=> select bucket => click on management => Create lifecycle rule

![alt text](shots/28.PNG)

=> Lifecycle rule name : forallcontent => choose rule scope : Apply to all objects in the bucket => select the acknowledge

![alt text](shots/29.PNG)

=> Lifecycle rule actions : Move current versions of objects between storage classes => choose storage class transitions : Standard-IA => Days after object creation : 31 => Add transition

![alt text](shots/30.PNG)

=> choose storage class transitions : Glacier Instant Retrieval => Days after object creation : 180 

![alt text](shots/31.PNG)

=> Create rule

![alt text](shots/32.PNG)
![alt text](shots/33.PNG)

*  Create a text file `hello` and upload to s3 into `docs`folder in the bucket with public access with some content and try accessing it 

![alt text](shots/34.PNG)
![alt text](shots/35.PNG)
![alt text](shots/36.PNG)
![alt text](shots/37.PNG)

* Now change the content and upload the file again

![alt text](shots/38.PNG)
![alt text](shots/39.PNG)
![alt text](shots/40.PNG)

* When we upload the file after changing the content, the older content gets overwritten. If you need to preserve the changes and content, enable _**Versioning**_

=> select bucket => click on Properties => Bucket Versioning => select Edit 

![alt text](shots/41.PNG)

=> Enable => Save changes

![alt text](shots/42.PNG)

=> change the content and upload again 

![alt text](shots/43.PNG)

=> show versions

![alt text](shots/44.PNG)

* AWS supports _**Enable**_ and _**Suspend**_ Versioning

### Static Website Hosting

* S3 uses `https` and it allows to host a static website
* Static website allows :
    * html
    * css
    * javascript
* Let's create a simple webpage with :
    * index.html (home page)
    ```
    <h1>Sample Webpage for learning</h1>
    ```
    * error.html (error page)
    ```
    <h1>Error occurred</h1>
    <h2>Contact your admin</h2>
    ```
    ![alt text](shots/45.PNG)

* Create a bucket with `ACLs enabled` and grant `public-read only access`

=> Create bucket => Bucket type : General purpose => Bucket name : mywebpage.website => Object Ownership : ACLs enabled => Bucket owner preferred => Block all public access : unseleccted => select acknowledge => Create bucket

![alt text](shots/46.PNG)

=> select the bucket => click on properties =>  go to Static Website Hosting => Edit 

![alt text](shots/47.PNG)

=> Static website hosting : Enable => Hosting type : Host a static website

![alt text](shots/48.PNG)

=>select the document type => Save changes  

![alt text](shots/49.PNG)

=> copy the URL obtained 

![alt text](shots/50.PNG)

=> Navigate to objects and upload the documents along with public access

![alt text](shots/51.PNG)

=> Expose over the wesite with the URL

![alt text](shots/52.PNG)

* We have added some bootstrap content to `index.html` as below :
```

### CDN ( Content Delivery Networks )

* Let's create an s3 bucket with video files and open them in some web page
* AWS has `edge locations` across the world 

  [ Refer Here : https://www.feitsui.com/en/article/3 ]

* To enable CDN, AWS has a service called as _**Cloud Front**_
* Let's create a distribution

=> Navigate through Cloud Front => Create Distribution => select Origin domain : qtvideos.learning => Create distribution

![alt text](shots/55.PNG)
![alt text](shots/56.PNG)
![alt text](shots/57.PNG)

* Replacing the s3 access links for videos to cloudfront names

```
<head></head>
<body>
    <div>
        <video width="320" height="240" controls>

```
![alt text](shots/59.PNG)

#### Replication to other regions

=> select a bucket => click on Mangement => Replication rules => Create replication rules

![alt text](shots/60.PNG)

=> Replication rule name : copyall => Enable bucket versioning

![alt text](shots/61.PNG)
![alt text](shots/62.PNG)

=> Source bucket : select Apply to all objects in the bucket

![alt text](shots/63.PNG)

=> Destination : Browse : qtwebpage.website => Enable bucket versioning

![alt text](shots/64.PNG)

 =>  IAM role : select Create new role 
 
![alt text](shots/65.PNG)
 
=> Save => select yes,replicate existing objects => Submit

![alt text](shots/66.PNG)

=> Generate completion report : choose browser as the destination => Save

![alt text](shots/67.PNG)

=> A job gets created

![alt text](shots/68.PNG)

* Replication rules will create s3 jobs

* In the local system we change as follows :
```
-> aws s3 cp s3://qtvideos.learning s3://mywebpage.website
-> aws s3 cp --recursive s3://qtvideos.learning s3://mywebpage.website
-> aws s3 sync s3://qtvideos.learning s3://mywebpage.website
-> mkdir c:\temp\content
-> cd c:\temp\content
-> aws s3 sync s3://qtvideos.learning .
-> ls
-> cp c:\local sysytem\Downloads\*.mp3
-> ls
-> aws s3 sync . s3://qtvideos.learning 
```
### Using CLI

* AWS S3 supports two cli commands
    * s3
    * s3 api (low level operations)
* AWS CLI has the following syntax :

  `aws <service> <action> [--arg1 value1 --argn valuen]`
* Let's work with CloudShell today

![alt text](shots/69.PNG)
![alt text](shots/70.PNG)

* s3 bucket uri : `s3://<bucket-name>`
* s3 object uri : `s3://<bucket-name>/folder-name/object-name` `s3://qttesting/videos/one.mp4` or `s3://qttesting/one.mp4`
* Open aws s3 cli docs :

    [ Refer Here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ ]

* _**ls**_ :
  
  ![alt text](shots/71.PNG)
  ![alt text](shots/72.PNG)

* _**mb**_ : create the bucket
    * create a s3 bucket `qts3fromcli`

      ![alt text](shots/73.PNG)    

    * In this bucket create two folders :
        * music 
        * videos
    * In the `music` folder upload some files
      ```
      touch one.mp3
      aws s3 cp one.mp3 s3:\\music\one.mp3
      ```
    * In the `videos` folder upload some files
      ```
      touch one.mp4
      aws s3 cp one.mp4 s3:\\videos\one.mp4
      touch two.mp4
      aws s3 cp two.mp4 s3:\\videos\two.mp4
      ```
    * Show the contents
        * of all the buckets
        * of music folder

        ![alt text](shots/74.PNG)

    * Remove the bucket `aws s3 rb --force s3://qts3fromcli`
* To upload a file `aws s3 cp`

#### Example

* Create a bucket with name which has source in it and one more bucket with name which has destination in it.
* Uplod some files in to `Source bucket` (ensure you have folders) and copy the contents into `Destination bucket`
    * copy one file
    * copy all the buckets
        * use sync
        * use recursive copy
    * `mv` move the object in a bucket from one folder to other folder
* Delete all the buckets
* Upload a file into a bucket with `public-read permissions`
* Example
```
echo "Hello" > one.txt
aws s3 ls
aws s3 cp one.txt s3://qtvideos.learning/one.txt --acl public-read
```
* Go to bucket => copy URL => expose over browser

### S3 Bucket Policies

* S3 has a resource based access policy which is referrd as s3 bucket policies
* S3 has support of _**acl (access control list)**_ where we can provide basic access levels such as :
    * private
    * public-read
    * public-write
* We can create s3 bucket policies using policy generator 

  [ Refer Here : https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html ]

* Let's create a bucket in s3
* Consider the following bucket policy, which gives accces to all objects from a specific ip :
```
{
  "Id": "Policy1681791649818",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1681791641953",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::qtaccesspolicy", "arn:aws:s3:::qtaccesspolicy/*"],
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "49.205.254.230/32"
        }
      },
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
* Add the policy to S3 bucket





* Upload some text / audio / video file into the bucket. Try accessing the ipaddress which gets access to a file



* For others we get access denied
* Let's change the policy to
```
{
  "Id": "Policy1681791649818",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1681791641953",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::qtaccesspolicy", "arn:aws:s3:::qtaccesspolicy/*"],
      "Condition": {
        "NotIpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "49.205.254.230/32"
        }
      },
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
* Now if we want to give access to specific aws user `qtdevops`
```
{
  "Id": "Policy1681791649818",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1681791641953",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::qtaccesspolicy", "arn:aws:s3:::qtaccesspolicy/*"],      
      "Principal": "arn:aws:iam::678879106782:user/qtdevops"
    }
  ]
}
```
* Now if we want to give access to specific aws user `devops`
```
{
  "Id": "Policy1681791649818",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1681791641953",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::qtaccesspolicy", "arn:aws:s3:::qtaccesspolicy/*"],      
      "Principal": "arn:aws:iam::678879106782:group/devops"
    }
  ]
}
```
* _**Exercise**_ : Write a bucket policy to give access to all on your objects in a bucket
```
{
  "Id": "Policy1681791649818",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1681791641953",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::qtaccesspolicy", "arn:aws:s3:::qtaccesspolicy/*"],      
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
#### Overview of Other Storage Types

* _**Virtual Disks**_ : This storage acts a disk to an ec2 instance. To create Virtual Disks we have two options :
    * Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
    * Instance-Store
* _**Network Disks**_ : To create network disks also we have two options :
    * Elastic File Share (EFS)
    * FsX
* _**EBS/Instance-Storage**_ are disk storages which are used to serve one instance at a time, where as _**EFS/FsX**_ are used to serve multiple machines over the network
* _**Disk Technologies**_
    * Magnetic
    * Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
    * Solid State Drives (SSD)
* Important _**factors of Disk**_
    * Size
    * Speed
* _**Performance of the disks**_ are measured using :
    * IOPS
    * Throughput

#### AWS Disk Storages

#### Amazon Elastic Block Storage

* This is a service that offers a persistent storage for ec2 instances
* EBS has to be _**os disk**_ in AWS
* EBS will be from the same zone in a region where ec2 is launched
* EBS is physically located in different server in the same zone where ec2 is launched where as instance store comes from the same physical location
* _**Instance store**_ is supported only by few instance types
* AWS uses a term called as _**Volume**_ to represent disk
* Root volume is disk with os which has to be EBS



* EBS can be attached to only one ec2 instance at any given moment
* Backups of EBS volumes are called as _**Snapshots**_
* Snapshots can be taken manually or AWS Backup service can automatically take backups according to schedules
* _**EBS Volumes types**_
    * _**General Purpose SSD**_ :
        * IOPS : 100 to 16,000 IOPS
        * good performace at low cost
    * _**Provisioned IOPS SSD**_ :
        * IOPS : 100 to 100000 iops
        * Size to IOPS ratio has to be between (1:50)
    * HDD-Backed Volume
    * Throughput Optimized HDD
    * ColdHDD



* AWS can provide :
    * empty disks to EC2
    * disks from snapshots to EC2
* EC2 disk sizes can be increased, but not decreased

#### Amazon Elastic File Share

* Fully managed file share which can be mounted to multiple linux instances
* This is storage from network, so it comes with security group
* _**Performance Mode**_ :
    * General Purpose
    * Max I/O Mode
* EFS cannot be mounted as os disk, where as can be mounted on any other disk

#### Experiments

* Create two ubuntu ec2 instances in any region





* Make a note of Volumes created



* Create a snapshot of volume




* From snapshot create a new volume in different _**AZ ( Availability Zone )**_





* From snapshot create a new volume in different Region
    * Select Snapshot
    * Copy snapshot to any region
    * from there create ebs volume




#### Next Steps

* Create a new empty volume (Size 1 GB)
* Mount this to one ec2 instance
* Create a xfs based file system
* Restart the machine
* See what are mounts attached

#### Tasks

* Create an ec2 instance



* Create a new empty volume (Size 1 GB)



* Attach the volume to ec2



* Mount this to ec2 instance




* Create a xfs based file system



* Let's mount this to a folder / tools




* Restart the machine
* See what are mounts attached




* If we need to preserve the mounts we need to deal with _**fstab**_
* Execute `sudo blkid` and make a note of block id info
```
/dev/xvdf: UUID="1b12551c-f61d-4847-bd9d-30fbff96668a" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="xfs"
```
* Add the following info to `/etc/fstab` 
```
UUID=ed4b67f9-3002-461b-ac30-0bb71e4c3f4c /tools xfs defaults,nofail 1 2
```
* Let's restart the machine and check mounts

* Lab Setup
    * Ensure you have two linux instances up and running in the same region
    * Try doing the single machine and attaching disks in windows

#### Overview of Disks on Windows and linux



#### Elastic File Share

* This is network file share
* Security group exists for EFS
* EFS is a regional resource, where we mention in which zones we want to have mounts. Sync of data across AZâ€™s is managed by AWS
* EFS works only with linux instances
* Let's create two ec2 instances in different zones



* Create a efs file share

* Installation instructions for linux 

    [ Refer Here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-mount-helper-ec2-linux.html ]

* Mount one ec2 instance and create files





#### AWS FsX

* FSx is an AWS Managed service for file shares from third parties
* As of now AWS supports :
    * NetAPP
    * Windows File Share
    * ZFS
    * Lustre



#### Glacier
* For Glacier Data Models

    [ Refer here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-data-model.html ]

* Create a vault 

    [ Refer Here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/creating-vaults-cli.html ]

* For the glacier cli

    [ Refer here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/glacier/ ]

* Create a vault
```
aws glacier create-vault --acount-id <your-acc-id> --vault-name 'qtvault'
```



* Create a zip file with some content
* Upload the zip file to the vault 

    [ Refer Here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/uploading-archive-single-operation.html ]



* If you want to deal with large file by breaking that into multiple parts

    [ Refer here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/uploading-an-archive-mpu-using-cli.html ]

* For downloading the archive (during disasters)

    [ Refer here : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/downloading-an-archive-using-cli.html ]

* To get all the archive ids
```
aws glacier initiate-job --vault-name awsexamplevault --account-id 111122223333 --job-parameters "{\"Type\":\"inventory-retrieval\"}"
```
* Glacier has 3 types :
    * Instant Retrieval (costliest glacier storage cost)
    * Instant Flexible Retrival
    * Deep archive (cheapest glacier storage cost)
